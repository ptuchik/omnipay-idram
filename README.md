[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.5+. This package implements iDram support for Omnipay.

## Installation

Omnipay is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it
to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "ptuchik/omnipay-idram": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

And run composer to update your dependencies:

    composer update

Or you can simply run

    composer require ptuchik/omnipay-idram

## Basic Usage

1. Use Omnipay gateway class:

```php
    use Omnipay\Omnipay;
```

2. Initialize iDram gateway:

```php

    $gateway = Omnipay::create('Idram');
    $gateway->setAccountId(env('ACCOUNT_ID'));
    $gateway->setSecretKey(env('SECRET_KEY'));
    $gateway->setLanguage(\App::getLocale()); // Language
    $gateway->setAmount(10); // Amount to charge
    $gateway->setTransactionId(XXXX); // Transaction ID from your system

```

3. Call purchase, it will automatically redirect to iDram's hosted page

```php

    $purchase = $gateway->purchase()->send();
    $purchase->redirect();

```

4. Create a webhook controller to handle the callback request at your `RESULT_URL` and catch the webhook as follows

```php

    $gateway = Omnipay::create('Idram');
    $gateway->setAccountId(env('ACCOUNT_ID'));
    $gateway->setSecretKey(env('SECRET_KEY'));
    
    $purchase = $gateway->completePurchase()->send();
    
    // Do the rest with $purchase and response with 'OK'
    if ($purchase->isSuccessful()) {
        
        // Your logic
        
    }
    
    return new Response('OK');

```
